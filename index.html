          Hello! I'm glad you're here. My name is Marshall, I've lived in Orlando, Florida for the majority of my life. 
          I am an avid rock climber, gamer, musician and most of all, coder! My favorite colors are purple and yellow (if the background I chose didnt give me away), 
          my favorite type of food is seafood and the person I look up to the most in my life is my paternal grandfather.
          My goal is to pursue a career as a professional Web Developer to fulfill my desire to create, 
          my desire to achieve and my desire to belong to something larger than myself.
      </p>
