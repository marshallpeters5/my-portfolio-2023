          Hello! I'm glad you're here. My name is Marshall, I've lived in Orlando, Florida for the majority of my life. 
          I am an avid rock climber, gamer, musician and most of all, coder! My favorite color is yellow (if the background I chose didnt give me away), 
          my favorite type of food is seafood and the person I look up to the most in my life is my paternal grandfather.
          My goal is to pursue a career as a professional Web Developer to both fulfill a desire to create, 
          a desire to achieve and a desire to belong to something larger than myself. <br><br>
          Below you will find my works and projects that I have solely contributed to. Feel free to browse!
